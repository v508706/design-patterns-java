	 * 
	 * Multiple interface doing same kind of jobs
	 * java.sql.Connection is example  In Java, the interface JDBC can be called a facade because, we as users or clients create connection using the “java.sql.Connection” interface, the implementation of which we are not concerned about. The implementation is left to the vendor of driver.
	 *  The facade pattern is appropriate when you have a complex system that you want to expose to clients in a simplified
	 *   way, or you want to make an external communication layer over an existing system which is incompatible with the system. Facade deals with interfaces, not implementation.
	 *   Its purpose is to hide internal complexity behind a single interface that appears simple on the outside.
