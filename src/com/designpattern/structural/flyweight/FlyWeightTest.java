	/**
	 * Flyweight pattern is one of the structural design patterns as this pattern provides ways to decrease
	 *  object count thus improving application required objects structure. 
	 *  Flyweight pattern is used when we need to create a large number of similar objects (say 10^5). 
	 *  One important feature of flyweight objects is that they are immutable.
	 *  This means that they cannot be modified once they have been constructed.
